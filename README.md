### GOOD TO KNOW

* Closing Issue using keyword [link](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords)
* VERY GOOD Pracical Guide to use setup.py [link](https://blog.godatadriven.com/setup-py)
* `setUp()` vs. `tearDown()`
  * In general you add all prerequisite steps to `setUp` and all clean-up steps to `tearDown`
  * So the idea is that test itself should contain only actions that to be performed on the test object to get the result, while `setUp` and `tearDown` are the methods to help you to leave your test code clean and flexible.
  * You can create a `setUp` and `tearDown` for a bunch of tests and define them in a parent class - so it would be easy for you to support such tests and update common preparations and clean ups

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
