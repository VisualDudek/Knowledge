# OBJECT LIFE CYCLE

## An Object's Storage Duration

_automatic memory manager_ or a _garbage collector_. At runtime, programs create objects. Periodically, the garbage collector deterines which objects are no longer required by the program and safely deallocates them. 

> _automatic object_ is allocated at the beginning of an enclosing code block
